This app is currently needed to log into the BackLogger app. (¡,¡)

After blocking anonymous reads on your Sprint 
backlog dataase—by making additions to the security object—you wont
be able to send anything to logged out users. Try this CouchApp out
of an anonymous-readable database so folks can log into the server.
