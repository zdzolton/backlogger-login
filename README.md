backlogger-login
===

This app is currently needed to log into the BackLogger app. (¡,¡)

Given that many of us will want to block anonymous reads on our 
Sprint backlogs—by making additions to the security object—you wont
be able to show anything from that entire database. So, you serve
this CouchApp out of an anonymous-readable database and folks can
log into the server.
